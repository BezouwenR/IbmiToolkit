IbmiToolkit
==========

This project was originally hosted at https://code.google.com/p/zend-ibmi-tk-cw/ and is now in its new home here.

This toolkit is a PHP-based front end to XMLSERVICE (www.youngiprofessionals.com/wiki/XMLSERVICE). Both parts of the toolkit are shipped with Zend Server and can also be downloaded, installed, and upgraded separately, being open source.
