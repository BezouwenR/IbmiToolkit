IbmiToolkit
==========

travis-ci status coming soon!

Introduction
------------

For production systems please do not use the master branch.  For the latest, or 
a previous, stable releases please see [releases](https://github.com/zendtech/IbmiToolkit/releases).

This project was originally hosted at https://code.google.com/p/zend-ibmi-tk-cw/ 
where older versions still reside. As of Mar. 3, 2014 it is now maintained here.

This toolkit is a PHP-based front end to XMLSERVICE (http://www.youngiprofessionals.com/wiki/XMLSERVICE). 
Both parts of the toolkit are shipped with Zend Server. Being open source, they 
can also be downloaded, installed, and upgraded separately.

Zend Server
-----------

The toolkit is already pre-installed with Zend Server, so you may not need to install.

Autoloading
------------

Versions larger than 1.6 will use a classmap to perform autoloading.

At some future point in time filenames and class names within the files will need 
to be refactored to match in order to allow for namespace autoloading.
