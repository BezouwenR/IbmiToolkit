IbmiToolkit
==========

This project was originally hosted at https://code.google.com/p/zend-ibmi-tk-cw/ 
where older versions still reside. As of Mar. 3, 2014 it is now maintained here.

This toolkit is a PHP-based front end to XMLSERVICE (http://www.youngiprofessionals.com/wiki/XMLSERVICE). 
Both parts of the toolkit are shipped with Zend Server. Being open source, they 
can also be downloaded, installed, and upgraded separately.

NOTE: Composer files and settings have been added to the master branch, as well 
as PHPUnit, however these are not fully implemented yet.

For the latest, or a previous, release please see [releases](https://github.com/zendtech/IbmiToolkit/releases).
